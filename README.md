## Manual
Initially, set and customize the variables that are at the beginning of the `index.php` file.

Run in CLI mode:
```
# php index.php
```
When run it for first time, you get two questions, put `a` and then put `u` and follow to complete.
Then you can run it in background with this command:
```
# nohup php index.php &
```
